-1. check if mu1, mu2, mu3 are resolvable, based on 2x stddev.
0. partition the data at 1.5mu and 2.5mu. if no data exists outside, then k=1. 
1. k-means cluster (k=3) to find the central cluster
2. for each side, partition the data 1.5 stddevs from the central cluster
3. k-means cluster (k=2) on the truncated data to find the side clusters
4. the highest and lowest values of the side clusters partition the data.
5. Calculate the mu and std for each segment.
6. check if the mu for each side cluster is within 1 stddev of the calculated mu
7. check that abs(skew) of all models is under 1.
8. if the checks fail, try modeling the whole thing as a Gaussian blob.
